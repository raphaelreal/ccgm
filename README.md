## PRE-SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

MAKE SURE YOU CLICK "Add Python 3 to PATH" IN THE INSTALLER
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-amd64.exe

2. Install .NET Redistributable (System restart may be required)
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

3. Install Sandboxie 
https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/download/v1.6.7/Sandboxie-Plus-x64-v1.6.7.exe

4. Download and unzip CCGM

5. Create a Discord server for your group!

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1. Go to the install folder and run the CrustaceanInstaller.exe to install mapmod if you haven't already. Run the game once then close it when you see the main menu. 

NOTICE: If your computer doesn't have a graphics card, you'll need to follow the installation guide here instead of using CrustaceanInstaller.exe

2. Right click Crab Game in Steam and click manage -> browse local files. Navigate to Bepinex -> plugins and replace the mapmod.dll with the one in your install folder. This is a custom version of mapmod I've created to be compatible with CCGM. Even if you're not hosting custom maps, it's important to add as it controls maps and modes. 

3. Double click the install_requirements.bat file to install all the dependencies you need.

4. Leave the install folder and navigate to the CCGM folder. Open the discord_invite.txt file and place your Discord invite inside. I recommend using an invite shortening service if your group doesn't qualify for a real one. Try https://dsc.gg/ or https://invite.gg/

5. Configure your ccgm_config.json file. I'll show you how to do this under the config instructions.

## CONFIG INSTRUCTIONS
1. Open up the ccgm_config.json file in your preferred text editor. Towards the top you'll see "your server name here". Replace that text with the name of the server you want to show in game.
