READ AFTER MAKING AN PATTERN
1. Find the file that you just created.
2. Right-click on the file and select "Rename".
3. Rename the file to "bd_20min_45max_name", where "name" is a name for the pattern you created.
4. The number "20" represents the minimum number of players required for the pattern to load. If there are fewer players in the game than the minimum, the pattern will not load. Adjust this number based on the requirements of your pattern.
5. The number "45" represents the maximum number of players that the pattern can support. If there are more players in the game than the maximum, the pattern will not load. Adjust this number based on the requirements of your pattern.
6. Once you have entered the new file name with the correct format and values, press "Enter" to save the changes.
7. Move the new file to the "animations" folder located at CCGM\animations.
8. Once the file is in the animations folder, it is ready to be used in your server.
